# CS-350-Thermostat

The project was to create a thermostat with our board that deteted temperature changes and had interrupts and switches in order to turn on the furnace or turn off the furnace based on the changes the board detected. The LED lights on the board would notify of the changes and you could use the buttons on the sides to interrupt and force a change. 
I didn't give up on my project even though I ran into techical errors a few times throughout the class course I continued to try to get past the errors and even reached out to the professor for help when it wouldn't read my local files. 
I could improve on knowing how to solve the technical issues I found it frustrating that I coulnd't get a video of my final project becuase i kept running into an error that wouldn't even allow me to build my project. 
I used the FAQ page on the TI page to try to find answers alot and there was alot of information there. I also looked up youtube videos that walked you through a problem or the whys without solving the issue for you so you still get the understanding without just getting the answer. 
I think the main coding and figure out the  switches and interrupts will be beneficial for me in the future especially when using embedded devies since they are becoming so popular in todays society. 
I set goals each week on what i wanted to accomplish in order to keep the project maintainable, readable and adapatable. I also used the best coding practices to keep everything readable.
